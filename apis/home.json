I have done various django based projects on website developement including this website and would continue to do so.",
        "para2": "After doing web dev, I stumbled upon machine learning, and found it very fascinating, influential and powerful branch of Technology field, The process of machine learning by observing data and improving itself to make accurate prediction, is itself more than a magic, having proficiency in ML implementation is like having power to predict future! That's why I'm in this field ;)"
